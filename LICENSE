SECTION 2: PALIMPSEST PHILOSOPHICAL OVERLAY
================================================================================

In addition to your chosen legal license, we encourage (but do not legally
require) adherence to the Palimpsest principles:

1. COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
   This software was built with cooperative economics in mind. We encourage
   users to consider worker welfare, fair wages, and labor conditions when
   deploying transport optimization systems. The constraint engine includes
   facilities for encoding labor standards (ILO minimums, working hour limits)
   as first-class optimization constraints.

2. ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
   Carbon optimization is a core feature, not an afterthought. We encourage
   users to weight environmental impact in their routing decisions and to
   publish their carbon savings transparently.

3. KNOWLEDGE SHARING
   In the spirit of palimpsest - text written over earlier text, layers of
   knowledge building upon each other - we encourage:
   - Publishing papers based on this work
   - Contributing improvements back to the community
   - Sharing operational learnings with other users
   - Building upon this foundation for the common good

4. TRANSPARENCY
   Transport systems affect workers, communities, and environments globally.
   We encourage transparent operation, public APIs where feasible, and open
   data sharing to advance the field.

5. SOLIDARITY
   This project was developed with solidarity economics principles in mind,
   recognizing that transport optimization can either exploit or uplift
   workers depending on how constraints are configured. Choose uplift.
